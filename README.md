Voting-System-in-PHP
====================

This is a simple voting system using PHP/MySQL. It takes votes in three letters A,B,C and inserts them into a database. There is a validation of the person who is voting based on the phone number. Only the phone numbers captured/registered will be allowed to vote. The voting results are displayed in the "index.php" file While the voting takes place in "voting.php"
